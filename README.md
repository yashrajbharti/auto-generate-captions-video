## Introduction

Only **0.5% of web videos include a ********`<track>`******** tag** (source: *[The Web Almanac by HTTP Archive 2024 Report](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/accessibility#audio-and-video)*), leaving a majority of online video content inaccessible for individuals who rely on captions. This project proposes a **built-in UI option in video elements** that enables browsers to auto-generate captions dynamically when a `<track>` element is missing. This solution aims to improve web accessibility without requiring explicit authoring changes.

## Goals

- Address the **accessibility gap** by promoting captions as a default feature on the web.
- Provide an implicit browser feature to generate captions dynamically when no `<track>` element exists.
- Simplify the process of captioning for users, reducing manual effort for developers.
- Allow user agents (UAs) to innovate and compete in improving the user experience.

## Non-goals

- Replace manually created captions or subtitles.
- Standardize the specific implementation of auto-generated captions across browsers.
- Focus on live video streams (future scope).

## User research

The proposal is informed by research indicating that captions improve content comprehension, user engagement, and accessibility for people with hearing impairments and non-native speakers. The **0.5% adoption rate** of `<track>` tags highlights the need for a low-effort solution that works automatically.

## Working Example

Using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JS) combined with Whisper API models by HuggingFace's transformer.js, here's a working example of [auto-generate captions](https://yashrajbharti.github.io/captions-on-the-fly/src/example.html) from this [GitHub repo for Captions on the Fly](https://github.com/yashrajbharti/captions-on-the-fly).

## Use cases

### Use case 1

A small business uploads product videos to their website but lacks the resources to create captions manually. By enabling the built-in captions option in the browser UI, users can generate captions dynamically, improving accessibility and SEO.

### Use case 2

An educational platform hosts a library of lecture videos. By leveraging the browser’s built-in captioning option, viewers can enable captions in their preferred language without requiring the platform to provide them manually.

## Potential Solution

### Solution Details

Instead of introducing an explicit `autogenerate` attribute in the `<track>` element, this proposal suggests that browsers implement an **implicit UI feature** in the video player. This feature allows users to opt-in for auto-generated captions when no `<track>` element is present.

For example:

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

When the browser detects the absence of a `<track>` element, it displays a captions button in the video player controls. Clicking the button triggers the browser’s built-in speech recognition and language models to generate captions dynamically.

### How this solution would solve the use cases

#### Use case 1

Small businesses can rely on the browser’s built-in captions feature to make their video content accessible without hiring transcription services.

#### Use case 2

Educational platforms can provide multi-language captions through the browser’s built-in UI, reducing the need for manual transcription efforts.

## Detailed design discussion

### Tricky design choice #1

How should browsers handle unsupported languages in the auto-generated captions feature?

Solution: Fallback to the default language or display a warning to the user that the selected language is unavailable.

### Tricky design choice #2

How can we prevent abuse or inaccurate captions from degrading the user experience?

Solution: Provide visual indicators (e.g., a "Generated Captions" badge) and allow users to toggle the feature on or off easily.

## Considered alternatives

### Alternative 1

Add the `autogenerate` attribute directly to the `<video>` element.

Rejected: Lacks flexibility for multi-language support and shifts responsibility to developers rather than empowering users.

### Alternative 2

Leave caption generation entirely to external tools.

Rejected: Adds complexity for developers and excludes dynamic web content.

## Stakeholder Feedback / Opposition

- **Positive Feedback**: Accessibility advocates emphasize the importance of lowering barriers to captioning.
- **Negative Feedback**: Some concerns about performance impacts for large video libraries.

## Feedback Q&A

### 1. **What if this leads to even fewer people manually creating subtitles?**

- **Answer:** While manual captions are often more accurate and tailored, the built-in captions feature is designed as a complementary tool, not a replacement. It ensures accessibility where no captions exist, providing an immediate benefit. To encourage manual captioning, browsers could display a notification recommending content creators add their own captions.

### 2. **Does it make sense for every user who watches a video to run the same subtitle creation steps repeatedly, or would it be better to run this once on the server and deliver the same subtitles to everyone?**

- **Answer:** Server-side generation ensures consistency and reduces computational load for users, but client-side generation offers flexibility for dynamic or personalized content. A hybrid approach—generating and caching captions locally—could optimize performance.

### 3. **What about videos on the web where it’s a live stream?**

- **Answer:** For live-streamed videos, real-time caption generation is essential. The proposed built-in feature is designed to handle such cases, ensuring accessibility for live events.

### 4. **How would it deal with a translated language that has very long words?**

- **Answer:** Browsers can handle text overflow by applying word wrapping, truncation, or adjustable font sizes. Developers could also provide styling options for captions to manage layout constraints.

### 5. **What if the generated subtitles don't fit the originally spoken parts?**

- **Answer:** The feature can include synchronization buffers and confidence thresholds to align captions with spoken content and suppress low-quality captions.

### 6. **Why are we not adding auto captions to the track element?**

- **Answer:** The `<track>` element by definition says, “Captions exist for this video, and this element provides them.” Introducing a case where a `<track>` element indicates, “Captions don’t exist, but the UA should generate them,” contradicts this purpose. Instead, leveraging the absence of a `<track>` element as a signal for auto-generation better aligns with the intent of the standard.
